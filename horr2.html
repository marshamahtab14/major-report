        Soon to be a major motion picture-Stephen King's terrifying classic.'They float..and when you're<br>
        downhere with me, you'll float, too.'To the children, the town was their whole world.To the adults,<br>
        knowing better,Derry Maine was just their home town:familiar,well-ordered for the most part.A good<br>
        place to live.It was the children who saw and felt - what made Derry so horribly different. In the<br>
        storm drains, in the sewers,IT lurked, taking on the shape of every nightmare,each one's deepest dread<br>
        Sometimes IT reached up, seizing, tearing, killing ...The adults,knowing better, knew nothing.Time passed<br>
         and the children grew up, moved away.The horror of IT was deep-buried, wrapped in forgetfulness. <br>
         Until theywere called back, once more to confront IT as IT stirred and coiled in the sullen depths of their<br>
        memories, reaching up again to make their past nightmares a terrible present reality.

Stephen King sure knows how to hold your attention. At first glance, at a mammoth 1300+ pages, this book looks very discouraging to the average reader. The first two chapters take a little time to pick up the pace, but once it does, boy oh boy, does it fly. Both terrifying, and hilarious in places, IT is very different from other horror novels

      The order was delivered well before time and the packing quality was good. I had been waiting eagerly since this book is considered as a masterpiece and I agree that the narrative style in the book,its content,the interweaving of dreams with reality and horrors,the development of characters is breath taking. King allows us to peek in the minds of each character and feel their weakness ,vulnerability.
The only con, I would like to point out is that the story seemed a little slow paced
